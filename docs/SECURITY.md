# Security

Reviewed 2026-09-30. This is an application security review, not an independent
penetration test or a guarantee of isolation between agent processes.

## Threat model

Protect against unauthenticated local HTTP clients, hostile websites, and tailnet
users attempting actions outside their project membership and access level.
Tailscale connectivity is not authentication. First-run setup is a local operation:
complete it before granting other people access to the machine.

The host owner, project owners, executable paths, repositories and agent CLI
configuration are trusted. Developers can send terminal input and run code as the
server's Unix user. Processes already running as that user can inspect credentials,
PTY arguments and files; HTTP authentication cannot isolate them. Separate hostile
tenants into separate OS accounts or machines.

## Protection

- Signed, HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookies; Secure when HTTPS terminates at a loopback
  proxy supplying `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`. Login and invite acceptance replace
  the presented session. Tokens have 256 random bits, are stored as SHA-256 hashes,
  and expire after 30 days without sliding renewal. Logout revokes the session.
- Argon2id passwords: 19 MiB memory, two iterations, one lane. Unknown accounts also
  perform password verification. Login reserves one of ten attempts per peer per
  15 minutes before hashing and gives it back when the login succeeds, so only failures
  count; invitation inspection/acceptance is limited the same way.
- Mutating API requests compare Origin against the exact scheme, Host and port;
  cross-site Fetch Metadata is rejected. Missing Origin supports non-browser
  clients; opaque `null` origins are rejected. WebSockets use the same origin
  comparison, revalidate sessions and check current membership for deliveries and
  terminal operations. API responses are not cached; pages suppress referrers.
- REST and team tools check membership, access, project/resource ownership and
  current gate eligibility. Initial host owner alone creates projects. Account
  rebinding, filesystem locations, admin grants and release approvers are owner-only.
  Owners and admins may invite an existing human seat without an email; acceptance
  binds only that still-unclaimed seat to the invited account, preserving its identity
  and roles. Inviter privileges are checked again under the config lock. Task import
  mode (original dates and bypassed stage gates) is owner-only and starts no work.
- Hook/MCP capabilities have 192 random bits and map to live sessions. Lookup is by
  complete random token, with no prefix comparison; signed cookies use the cookie
  library's signature verification. Hook permissions bind to the token-selected
  session and a unique inbox waiter, never a caller-supplied session identifier.
  Exit revokes capabilities; MCP rechecks after body reception. Hooks reject
  non-loopback peers, nonlocal Host/Origin and proxy headers before body parsing.
  MCP applies equivalent restrictions. Limits: API 5 MiB (JSON), attachment upload 25 MB
  per file (streamed, on its routes only), hooks 32 MiB, MCP 1 MiB, WebSocket frames
  1 MiB. The executable refuses non-loopback listen addresses.
- Task attachments live only under `PROJECTMAN_HOME/attachments`, behind the same cookie,
  origin and no-store protection and the project, task and attachment id check on every
  list, content, download, HEAD and delete; there is no static route. The size is counted
  from the bytes received (the limit applies to chunked bodies too) and the access is
  checked before the upload and again before it is published. Storage names are generated
  (project key, task key, id), the uploaded name is sanitised metadata only; directories
  are checked not to be symlinks, files are created exclusively and read without following
  links, and only regular files of the recorded size are served. Only a PNG, JPEG, GIF,
  WebP or PDF proven by its content is shown inline; everything else (HTML, SVG, renamed or
  unknown files) is an `application/octet-stream` download. All responses carry
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; sandbox`,
  `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` and an encoded `Content-Disposition`.
  Checked in Chrome against a local development server (2026-10-01): the PDF viewer opens a
  PDF served with that sandbox CSP, both as a page of its own and inside an iframe, a PNG
  loads in an `<img>`, HTML and SVG uploads are not rendered (they are downloads), and
  every content and download response carried exactly the headers listed here. Repeat the
  check after a Chrome major update or a change of these headers: the sandbox directive
  is what a browser may one day refuse to show a PDF under.
- AI members reach attachments through the team tools (PM-113), in their own name and under the
  same rules. `attach_file` never takes a directory from the caller: the server uses the working
  directory it recorded for the session the MCP token names. It opens only a regular file inside
  it (by whole path components, so a sibling with the same prefix is outside), refuses symbolic
  links anywhere on the way, files with several hard links, directories, FIFOs (opened without
  blocking), sockets and devices, and checks the opened handle afterwards: its real location
  must still be inside and be the very file opened, so a path swapped between the checks and the
  open is refused. The content is streamed from that handle and refused when its size or time
  changes meanwhile. A task session may read (never edit) only its own task's attachment
  directory without asking: Claude Code gets `Read(//…/**)` allowed and `Edit(//…/**)` denied for
  it, not an extra working directory, and nothing of the rest of `PROJECTMAN_HOME`; Codex gets
  no writable root there. `read_attachment` gives a path (images and PDFs through a hard link
  `<id>.<ext>` next to the file, removed with it), never the content.
- Git/gh and agents receive argument arrays. Task branches are sanitized; default
  branches pass git validation and fetch uses an option terminator. Repository
  paths stay inside their workspace; task worktrees stay inside their project
  folder, including resolved symlinks. Shell forwarder arguments are quoted; curl
  ignores user curl configuration and bypasses proxies. Known billing keys and
  endpoint overrides are stripped for both agent providers.
- Customization keys and version IDs are validated; commits name only the project
  path. Symlinked project paths are rejected. Git hooks/signing are disabled for
  customization commits. YAML is limited to 1 MiB per file, 50 levels and no aliases;
  parse errors do not echo source text. The application home is owner-only (0700).
- Request logging omits bodies, credentials and query strings, and redacts hook,
  MCP and invitation URL tokens. Unknown-route/parser errors do not echo request
  secrets. Authentication records are not broadcast. Markdown builds escaped React
  elements, permits HTTP(S) links only, and uses `noopener noreferrer`.

## Automatic command decisions

When the server auto-allows a Codex escalation (the routine git steps of a developer, lockfile
installs), that command runs outside Codex's sandbox with the server user's rights, including
the repository's git hooks and npm lifecycle scripts. The same holds for the read-only rule's
check commands (`npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npx vitest run`, `npx tsc --noEmit`): when a
Codex member's run escalates, for example because its tests listen on localhost, and the rule
allows it, it runs the project's own scripts outside the sandbox. Even a read-only `git` command
runs the programs the repository's configuration names (`core.fsmonitor`, diff and text
conversion drivers), and a Codex developer's sandbox may write that configuration. The allowed
forms are narrow, and a command the strict parser (`domain/shell-words.ts`) does not fully
understand always goes to a human. The read-only rule reads the command's text only: it cannot
see where a symbolic link in a worktree points. `xargs` takes names only from a lister
(`git ls-files`, `git diff --name-only`, `grep -l`, `find`, `ls`) through whole-line filters, and
runs only commands whose options cannot write or run anything (`cat`, `grep`, `wc`, …) or that
get the names after `--` (`git`, `rg`, `sort`), because a file named like an option would be
one. The names are taken as found, so a file whose path holds a blank or a newline can still
split into two items. A Codex member never runs in `bypassPermissions`, where nothing would be
asked at all.

Regression coverage includes cookie rotation/expiry, concurrent login attempts,
origin checks, revoked terminal access, project privileges, isolated permission
waiters, expired capabilities, body limits, path escapes, YAML limits, URL redaction,
provider environments and hostile markdown. Integration tests use fictional data,
temporary repositories and fake CLIs only.

## Before server hosting

1. Use a dedicated Unix account and private application home. Separate mutually
   untrusted users' agent processes, repositories and credentials at the OS boundary.
   Worktrees and role checks are not a filesystem sandbox. Review repository hooks,
   CLI configuration and permission modes before trusting a workspace.
2. Terminate HTTPS with Tailscale Serve. Preserve the public Host, overwrite
   `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and keep forwarding/identity headers so hook/MCP requests
   through the proxy are rejected. Prefer denying `/hooks` and `/mcp` at the proxy.
   Verify Secure cookies and the browser's exact origin against the deployed proxy.
3. Apply tailnet ACLs and proxy connection/body/rate limits. Keep the app bound to
   loopback; do not expose the development server. Provision the first owner locally.
4. Protect backups of SQLite, the signing secret, transcripts and customization
   history. Rotate exposed capabilities, review log retention and redact secrets
   before sharing transcripts. Audit dependencies and installed CLI versions during
   deployment; dependency vulnerability scanning was outside this source review.
