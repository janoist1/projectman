# Agent providers

An AI member runs in one of two agent CLIs, set per member (`provider` in `team.yaml`,
default `claude`): **Claude Code** on the sponsor's Claude plan, or **OpenAI Codex CLI**
on the sponsor's ChatGPT plan (decision 15). Both run as interactive TUIs in a PTY, never
through the Agent SDK, `claude -p`, `codex exec` or the Codex app server. The runner drives
them through provider adapters (`apps/server/src/runner/providers/`); the PTY session,
message queue, state machine, permission broker and transcript tailer are shared, and each
adapter declares its capabilities.

## Differences

| Hooks             | HTTP hooks (SessionStart through the forwarder) | command hooks running the forwarder; the PermissionRequest one prints the decision |
| Ready for input   | first SessionStart hook                         | composer on screen (SessionStart only fires with the first turn)                   |

## Claude Code

`claude` is started with `--session-id <uuid>` (new) or `--resume <uuid>`,
`--append-system-prompt`, `--mcp-config` (the team server), `--settings` (HTTP hooks,
pre-allowed and denied tools), `--model`, `--effort`, `--permission-mode`, `--add-dir`
(extra readable directories such as the developer's worktree for a reviewer) and
`-n <display name>`. The runner pre-accepts the workspace trust dialog for session
directories.

Claude members may choose a fixed model id, a latest-family alias, or a custom id. Their
optional effort (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`) is passed via `--effort` on new and
resumed sessions; unset effort uses Claude Code's own default. Clearing effort with a member
PATCH (`null`) restores that default.

## Codex

Codex is started as `codex [resume] --no-alt-screen --no-daemon
--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust --enable hooks -c … --sandbox <s> --ask-for-approval <a>
[--model <m>] -- [<id>] [<brief>]`. Every setting is a per-process `-c` override (update
check off, the directory trusted, hooks, the team MCP server with its tools pre-approved,
developer instructions); nothing is written to `~/.codex`.

The bypass flag lets our own hooks run without the one-time review in `/hooks`; it also runs
any other enabled hooks of the user's Codex config and of the trusted project's `.codex/`
folder, the same exposure as pre-trusting a Claude Code workspace (backlog PM-49).

Claude model aliases (`opus`, …) are not passed to Codex; such members get projectman's
default, `gpt-6.1-sol` at `medium` reasoning effort, rather than the owner's interactive
Codex default (which may be the most expensive model at the highest effort). A member may
name any Codex model explicitly. Codex maps effort `max` to `xhigh`. The CLI is `CODEX_BIN`
(default `codex` on `PATH`); transcripts are read from `CODEX_HOME` (default `~/.codex`).

Permission modes map to Codex's sandbox and approval policy; anything the sandbox does not
allow (writes elsewhere, network) is an escalation that reaches the PermissionRequest hook
and so the inbox:

| Permission mode       | Codex sandbox        | Approval     | Effect                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`             | `read-only`          | `on-request` | reads freely; every edit and write is asked             |
| `acceptEdits`, `auto` | `workspace-write`    | `on-request` | edits and commands in the workspace run; the rest asked |
| `plan`                | `read-only`          | `never`      | research only; nothing is asked or written              |
| `bypassPermissions`   | `danger-full-access` | `never`      | no sandbox, no questions                                |

Developers' Codex sessions may write the task worktree's git directory, so commits do not
escalate, while the network stays off. Codex's own sandbox still keeps `.git` read-only in
some cases (backlog PM-71 → PM-77).

## Session policy

The session policy (`apps/server/src/domain/session-policy.ts`) is the union of the member's
duties: editing duties work in the task worktree, read-only duties pre-approve reading tools,
and developer roles get everyday git and npm commands pre-approved. Reviewers get the
developer's worktree as an extra readable directory. The team tools are pre-approved for
every role. Codex needs no counterpart for the read-only tools: reading and
`git diff`/`log`/`show` run inside its sandbox without asking (`gh pr view`/`diff` need
network, so they are asked).

System decisions that never reach a human: publishing from a local-only repository (no
GitHub in its config) is denied, and a lockfile install inside the task worktree is allowed.
Both are recorded in the inbox history and the timeline. Denied tools are enforced through
Claude Code's settings; Codex relies on its sandbox and the PermissionRequest hook, so under
`bypassPermissions` nothing is asked (see the open questions in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)).

## Login and plan usage

Before spawning, the runner checks the provider's login (cached briefly). A CLI that is not
logged in with a subscription, or is logged in with an API key, is refused with
`provider_not_logged_in` (the domain answers 409 with `details.provider`). A login lost
mid-session (Claude Code: "Login expired · Please run /login"; Codex: a turn failing with
`unauthorized`) emits an `auth_error` runner event, stops the session and leaves it `failed`
with the message as its activity.

Plan usage is per provider: Claude's from Claude Code's usage probe, ChatGPT's from the rate
limits Codex records in its transcripts (nothing is spent to read either). New AI work pauses
above `pauseAbovePlanUsagePercent` of the plan of the member's own provider.

The runner strips `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` and
common OpenAI/Azure endpoint overrides from every session's environment.
